# 3D Reconstruction
3D Reconstruction with python
I used CMU 16-385 assignment 3 as my guideline and implemented the desired functions.

eight_point function implements the eight point algorithm and returns the fundamental matrix. \
epipolar correspondences function implements the epipolar correspondences algorithm and returns the corresponding points. \
triangulate function implements the triangulation algorithm and returns the 3D points. \
disparity map and depth map should be true disparity map works fine but depth map is not working properly for some reason.
Did not implement 4.2 and 4.3
